The purpose of this blog post is to help **beginner/intermediate** programmers
get to the next level in terms of their programming skill and hopefully in life.
Also I answer some questions that beginners often ask.

# Part 1 - Beginner to Intermediate

If you're just starting out, read this section **very carefully**.

## Realize YOUR potential!

If you're reading this you're most likely a member of the human race. We, humans,
are very limited and flawed creatures by design. Our mental abilities are not
that great. Our animalistic instincts and emotions often lead us astray, if
left unmanaged.

This is the first realization we have to make on our path to knowledge.
Learning is difficult for us humans! **We have to work really hard in order to
understand anything at all!**

On the other hand, considering our physical and mental limitations, some people
have done amazing things in their life!
In terms of knowledge and skill - **all of us can achieve a lot more than we
think is possible! Myself and YOU included!**

Fight against the animal instinct of **complacency**!

In order to reach **astonishing results** - we have to open our minds to
learning and push our human vessels **beyond the limit!**

## What about talent?

The other day a guy left a comment on one of my YouTube videos saying how he
envies me and my talent.
While I appreciate the flattering comment very, very much, I think that HE and
MANY OTHERS might be missing out on important facts.

The truth is - in order to become an **expert programmer** you don't need much
talent.
For example - I would rate my mental abilities as AVERAGE. Some concepts I
grasp very quickly and very well, others not so quickly and not very well. That's just how my brain
works. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

The thing that actually matters is **motivation**. My **motivation** stems from
my **curiosity** about computers. I would rate my curiosity as EXTREME. That's
what allowed me to get really good, really fast.

## Gather knowledge!

In terms of knowledge availability - we live in the best time in history so far.
Thousands of books, courses, videos are available FOR FREE! You can take online
college classes FOR FREE! This is the first time in history that we have
these kinds of learning opportunities accessible anywhere in the world! Take
advantage of it!

There are also countless learning resources available for purchase. Keep in
mind that buying learning materials and consuming them is one of the best
investments of time and money that you can make.

Ideally you should find a mentor. A good mentor can give you directions so that
you don't go wandering around. Try finding a mentor who can advise you
face to face. If that is not possible, resort back to online resources.

Ingest huge amounts of learning materials every day. You need to GULP KNOWLEDGE
not sip it through a straw. A 1000+ page book is nothing! Go through dozens of
these! **GULP KNOWLEDGE!**

> Don't restrain from reading books twice, three times or even more. I would
  even recommend it, especially to beginners.

## Power through the fundamentals!

Learning something new can feel very painful and aimless at first. Beginner
programmers often struggle with learning because they simply don't understand
that it takes **time** and **effort** to learn how to program a computer.

The other day I delved into WebGL (3D graphics programming for the browser)
and once again, **I felt like a beginner**. While WebGL is pretty easy, there
are still a lot of _fundamentals_ to go through and understand before you can
build anything meaningful with it. While I was very comfortable with general
programming and math I knew almost nothing about 3D computer graphics.

This is exactly how it is when initially learning to program a computer.

You start by learning a lot of fundamentals and most of the time you're not
even sure **why you're learning them**. You don't see the big picture - **what can be
built with these small building blocks?** You have to embrace these uncomfortable
feelings and just **POWER THROUGH**. Know that the painstaking process of
learning the fundamentals is going to pay off dividends very soon.

> Keep in mind that the first 100 hours of learning something new are the most
  uncomfortable.
  After you've spent 100 hours or more learning something, only then you can
  make a judgement if that vocation is for you or not.

## Pay attention to every single detail

While learning, you have to be extremely precise and pedantic when it comes to
understanding concepts. Make sure that you **100%** understand everything that
you're learning.
This is very hard, but practicing a engineering-like rigor is the
thing that will make you an exceptional programmer. Just like engineering,
computer programming is very strict. The smallest detail matters.

Pay extremely close attention to every character, symbol, naming convention,
terminology, command, abbreviation, acronym, EVERYTHING! Be precise when
using terminology in your speech and writing.

Apart for being great for learning, being extremely precise and pedantic at all
times is going to prepare you to do your best work once the time comes.

> TIP: When going through learning materials, type every example program and
  run it yourself on your computer! This will greatly reinforce learning.

## Be comfortable with not knowing everything

This directly contradicts the previous point, but that's life. Absolute truths
are extremely rare.

A huge emotional muscle that you need to build as a computer programmer is
**being comfortable with abstractions**. We are all standing on the shoulders
of giants when it comes to almost anything in life, and this is especially true
in the world of computers and programming.

You actually can't know everything when first starting out and that's fine.
Understand as much as you can and just move on.

## Apply knowledge

> "Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do." - Bruce Lee

As the legendary Bruce Lee says, apply your newfound knowledge as soon as possible. Even if
you know very little, try to build a program with that knowledge. This
is important because if you don't reinforce learning by applying what you
learned, the information gets lost really fast.
By struggling to apply the learnings - our brain reinforces the concepts and
remembers them more permanently.

Now, a lot of beginners don't know what kind of projects to build. I would say
pick something you're interested in besides programming. For example, it can be
something about sports, the stock market, fashion, video games, art, music,
history, whatever...

Building a project might feel intimidating and hard from a beginner perspective,
so feel free to make small toy programs at first, and lots of them. 
You might go ahead and start building a project just to find out that it
actually is too hard for you at that point. That is fine as well. Failure is
not important, you're just practicing.

When I was first learning to program, I started building a graphing calculator
in Java, so that I can visualize different mathematical functions (similar to
how MatLab does it). Here is how that turned out:

![Function Graphs](/images/2019-07-20-how-to-become-an-expert-part-1/graph.png "Function Graphs")

Needless to say that I failed to create a complete program. **But I made
SOMETHING and applied what I've previously learned.** That is the only thing
that matters when learning.

So go ahead and write a program!

> Even though these practice projects are small and seemingly insignificant,
  treat them as VERY IMPORTANT. Try to do your best on each and every one of
  them!
  This will prepare you to do serious work in the future. When the time comes
  to create something important, you will be well-prepared to create quality work,
  since you've been doing it all along!

## Learn how to find answers on the internet

Today (in 2019) the internet is full of answers to both general and super-specific
questions when it comes to programming. 
As a beginner, you can find everything that you need online.
So learn how to use your search engine(s) well!

## Large programs are not scary.

As a beginner, you will probably be intimidated by **large codebases**.
I remember, when I was first starting out, that I couldn't imagine holding even
500 lines of code in my head. **That seemed like an awful lot of code!** But
it's really not. As you learn and write more and more code, your capacity will
grow and you will be able to grasp more and more.

Looking at other people's code was really intimidating to me as well. Various
open-source projects seemed opaque. I thought they were impossible to understand.

Just know that, **with time, you're going to easily be able to read code that you
didn't write** and make sense of it relatively quickly.

## Attend meetups

Another great way to push yourself is to attend local meetups and user groups.
You can find these on the internet, just search for '`[your_city] programming or
technology meetups`'. If you don't live in a bigger city with an active IT
culture, try traveling to the nearest one in order to attend.

If you're a beginner, a lot of the meetup talks/speeches/presentations will fly
over your head. It will be too much for you to handle. The speakers / other
attendees will probably be way ahead of you in terms of knowledge and skill.
It might be very uncomfortable.

But that's a great thing. Being around people that are way better than you will
help you grow via the process of _osmosis_. Most programmers are willing to
help you out or give useful advice. Listen to them very carefully!

Another crucial thing is to **be proactive!**

Have you ever been to a public meetup where everyone was silent except the
speakers? Don't be like that, **be proactive**.

Applaud the speaker, participate in the event, contribute to the atmosphere,
stay after the meetup and talk to the speaker and the attendees... **wake up
and contribute!**

## What programming language to choose?

Doesn't matter. **Just pick one and learn it extremely well before moving on.**

Important things to consider when picking a programming language:

- Is the language popular? Do a lot of people use it?
- Is there a big market demand for that language?

## How long does it take to become a proficient programmer?

It takes around **2 years** of **learning**, **practicing** and **working on
projects** to become comfortable with programming. That means **2 years of at
least 40-hours of active work per week**.

If that seems like a lot, it's really not. For comparison, to become a
proficient musician it takes way more work than that.

If you're passionate about programming you're going to spend way more than 40
hours per week on it anyways, which may allow you to grow faster.

> It took me around 2 years to get proficient, but **you can go faster by working
  with mentors**. A great mentor will give you the largest possible boost in
  understanding a topic such as programming. I don't really offer mentorship
  these days, but if you're crazy passionate and driven, shoot me an email and
  I will consider it.

## Do I have to know math?

Many beginners ask this question. Here are the answers:

If you want to be an **intermediate** programmer, then **you do not need math**.

If you want to be an **expert**, then **absolutely yes**. You do need to know at
least high-school level math.

If you want to reach towards **mastery** then you have to at least be familiar
with college-level math.

This also depends on the type of programming that you do, but the answers above
are true for most programmers.

Basic math is really not that hard, just go ahead and learn it if you feel the
need to.


## Moving on...

Applying the principles and practices from this blog post will turn **anyone**
into a proficient programmer.

In **Part 2**, I'll write about what it takes to become an **expert!**
