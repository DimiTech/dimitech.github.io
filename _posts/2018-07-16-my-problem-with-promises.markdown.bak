I don't particularly fancy Promises, and here are some problems I have with
them as well as solutions to those problems.

## Problem 1: Promise chains often force "global" variables in their surrounding scope

Promises are not really great for long-running chains of inter-dependent async
operations.

Let's say we have to make a buch of async calls.

The ugliness can emerge:

- When some of the async calls need data that is being produced by previous
  promise calls.

Splitting the declaration and assignment of variables like this is just
annoying.
  
This means we have to capture that data and make it available downstream. Example:

```javascript
getUserInfo(userId)
  .then(userInfo => {
    const { shoppingCartId, shoppingCartItems } = userInfo
    return Promise.all(shoppingCartItems.forEach(item => checkIfItemsInStock(item)))
  })
  .then(itemsAvailable => {
    if (itemsAvailable.every(item => item.isAvailable)) {
    
    }
  })
```
