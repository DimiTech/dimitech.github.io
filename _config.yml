  Hi, I'm Dušan.
  <br>
  <br>
  My specialty is programming, but I'm also into videography, music, extreme sports, art and ecology.
  <br>
  <br>
  I program for the web although I dabble in C/C++ and game programming as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides writing code, I run workshops, speak at meetups/conferences, write, make YouTube videos etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highly passionate about educating, empowering and helping people in general.
