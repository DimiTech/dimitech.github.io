about: >
  Hi, I'm Dimi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently my main obsession is programming, but I'm also into videography, music, extreme sports, art, philosophy and ecology.
  <br>
  <br>
  I program for the web although I dabble in C/C++ and graphics programming as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides writing code, I run workshops, speak at meetups/conferences, write, make YouTube videos etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highly passionate about educating, empowering and helping people in general.
  <br>
  <br>
